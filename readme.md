# STARFALL V1

A browser game and HTML5 Canvas/animation experiment.

*by Wade Collier*

## Overview

Starfall is my first foray into HTML5 Canvas and game design. It's a humble effort, but I've had a blast making it and continue to add features when I have time! As it stands, it is a simple point and click game in which you direct a mysterious, bow-legged egg man from one edge of the canvas to the other in a quest to catch falling pixel-stars and accumulate good vibes in the process.

## A note on the project

All pixel art assets are original pixel creations. Animations for falling stars and the character are pulled from Photoshop exported sprite sheets and implemented via the Sprite methods courtesy of Create.js.

Right now the project is running on the default createjs.Ticker timing mode, which may not be optimal for all browsers. Safari, for instance, tends to run Starfall a little slower than Firefox and Chrome. I'm still learning how to animate HTML and JavaScript properties in the browser and I intend to look further into this issue to optimize performance as I continue working on the project.

## My goals/projected additions to Starfall

* animated intro/start screen
* sound
* antagonist meteor elements that decrease your vibes
* animated pop ups when you nab falling stars
* animated bitmap background
* levels?
* character selection?

## Technologies used:

 * JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
 * Photoshop
 * [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
 * [CreateJS library](https://createjs.com/)
